# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy and Cookies Statement describes how the Regenerative Finance Foundation and its affiliated companies (referred to in this document as “Kolektivo,” “we,” “us” or “our”) collects, uses, shares and otherwise processes Personal Data (defined below) including:
Visitors to our website(s), mobile applications and other online properties (“Site” or “Sites”)
Any other individual about whom Kolektivo may obtain Personal Data
In this Privacy Policy, “Personal Data” means information that (either in isolation or in combination with other information held by Kolektivo) enables you to be identified as an individual or recognized directly or indirectly. We may collect Personal Data when you use our Sites.

## Overview

Unless we specifically state otherwise, Kolektivo is the data processor of the Personal Data we process, and is therefore responsible for ensuring that the systems and processes we use are compliant with data protection laws, to the extent applicable to us. Kolektivo personnel are required to comply with this Privacy Policy and complete data protection training, where appropriate.
Collection of Personal Data

Kolektivo collects information that you provide directly to us when you use our products, browse our Site, register to receive newsletter requests or other information, provide feedback through surveys, participate in any interactive features on our Sites including contests, promotions, challenges, activities or events. We also collect data provided by job applicants or others on our Sites or offline means in connection with employment or consulting opportunities, which may also be subject to other Policies. We may also collect Computer Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifier (“UDID”), cookies, web beacons, web server logs and other technologies and other data linked to a device, and data about usage of our Sites (Usage Data). A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.

With your consent, Kolektivo may access an encrypted version of your contacts' phone number which will be used by our service to find who of your contacts are already on Kolektivo. However, no personal information will be shared with anyone directly, including Kolektivo.

Other types of information we may collect include your name, email address, username, password, phone number, location and any other information you choose to provide. We may use these automated technologies to collect information about your equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns. The information we obtain in this manner may include your device IP address, identifiers associated with your devices, types of devices connected to our services, web browser characteristics, device characteristics, language preferences, referring/exit pages, clickstream data, and dates and times of visits to our Site.

Kolektivo may require certain information from time to time for purposes of meeting its know-your-customer and customer due diligence requirements specifically to comply with anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism obligations.
